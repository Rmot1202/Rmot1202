## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- **Neutron Event Detection Research** using Support Vector Machines.  
- **Climate & Agricultural Yield Prediction** with deep learning on USDA + WRF-HRRR datasets.  
- **Urban Heat Island Mitigation** through geospatial analytics in R.  
- **Cybersecurity Risk & Forensics** with Cisco Packet Tracer, Autopsy, and FTK Imager.  
- **Smart Accessibility Devices** and AI-powered apps for inclusive communication.

## 🏢 Work & Research Experience

- 🎓 [**MS-CC Undergraduate Summer Research Symposium (2025)**](https://ms-cc.org/2025-ms-cc-undergraduate-summer-research-symposium/)  
  Presented my summer research in **climate-driven agricultural yield prediction** at the annual symposium.  

- 🔬 [**MS-CC Undergraduate Summer Research Internship**](https://ms-cc.org/about-us/undergraduate-summer-research-internship/)  
  10-week NSF-funded internship at Fisk University & Meharry Medical College. Built machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) for predicting crop yields under climate stress.  

- 📊 [**VSU Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG)**](https://www.vsu.edu/research/dspg-recruitment.php)  
  Conducted **Urban Heat Island analysis** for Petersburg, VA, finding a negative correlation (R² = 0.60) between tree cover and heat index.  

- 🌱 [**Savannah River Environmental Sciences Field Station (SRESFS)**](https://sresfs.net/)  
  Worked on **cybersecurity risk assessments** and forensic investigations. Built secure VLAN-based networks in Cisco Packet Tracer and completed Digital Forensics Essentials labs.
